abstract = {Drawing upon multiple disciplines, avant-garde fashion-tech teams push the boundaries
between fashion and technology. Many are well trained in envisioning aesthetic qualities
of garments, but few have formal training on designing and fabricating technologies
themselves. We introduce Mannequette, a prototyping tool for fashion-tech garments
that enables teams to experiment with interactive technologies at early stages of
their design processes. Mannequette provides an abstraction of light-based outputs
and sensor-based inputs for garments through a DJ mixer-like interface that allows
for dynamic changes and recording/playback of visual effects. The base of Mannequette
can also be incorporated into the final garment, where it is then connected to the
final components. We conducted an 8-week deployment study with eight design teams
who created new garments for a runway show. Our results revealed Mannequette allowed
teams to repeatedly consider new design and technical options early in their creative
processes, and to communicate more effectively across disciplinary backgrounds.},
